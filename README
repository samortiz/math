Admin 
  Use generatequestions.py to generate all the questions in the
  database.  This may take a very long time depending on how many 
  questions you want to create.  I usually would comment out parts of 
  the file and run different sets of questions. 

Installation : 
  To setup you will need to use a postgres database
  You need to set your username and password in db_functions.py 

  To initialize the database you can use the create_schema.sql script
  run it with a command like : 
     psql -d math -U www -f create_schema.sql
